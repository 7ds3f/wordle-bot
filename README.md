# wordle-bot
A discord wordle bot.

This bot requires PyEnchant to function properly
to install PyEnchant, use pip install pyenchant in cmd

this branch is my area to mess around (Nahuel)

ToDo:
Figure out when wordle.init.py ends a game
Add congratulatory msg for wins and fail msg for losses
Possibly separate feudle words by length
optimize code
