# wordle-bot
A discord wordle bot.

This bot requires PyEnchant to function properly
to install PyEnchant, use pip install pyenchant in cmd

this branch is my area to mess around (Nahuel)

ToDo:
Figure out when wordle.init.py ends a game
Add congratulatory msg for wins and fail msg for losses
Put reading of both word files into main.py to reduce wait times
Ask Edmond about other branches
Possibly separate feudle words by length
optimize code
Ask Edmond things
